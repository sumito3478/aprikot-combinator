/**
 * An implementation of z-combinator - Z(a) == {x => a(Z(a))(x)}.
 *
 * It generates a function with anonymous recursion.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * {{{
 * import info.sumito3478.aprikot.combinator.{|>, Z}
 *
 * val i = ({
 *   f: (Int => Int) =>
 *     {
 *       n : Int =>
 *         n match {
 *           case m if m < 2 => m
 *           case _ => f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
 *         }
 *     }
 * } |> Z[Int, Int])(7)
 * // i == 13
 * }}}
